Today is Day 9 of #100DaysofK8s and I am working through [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) from [The Linux Foundation](www.linuxfoundation.org/â€Ž
) of [Edx.org](https://edx.org).

Today I will be going over the section on Kubernetes Volume Management.

### The Need for Data Persistence

Containers are meant to be ephemeral in nature meaning they can be created, destroyed, or moved on a whim. This becomes a problem when data needs to be used or created by the applications running in a container. Kubernetes handles this by allowing the use of Volumes to be mounted as Directories or Files in a Pod.   

### Kubernetes Volumes

Directories that are mounted to Pods are backed by various volume types in Kuberntes. A few of these include configMaps, secrets, hostPath, and persistentVolumeClaims.

More information about different volume types is available in the [Kuberenetes Docs page on Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/).
### PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.

PersistentVolumes are requests made against the Kubernetes API for a Volume defined by a storage class to be created for later use. The persistent volumes are then claimed by users making a PersistentVolumeClaim. The claim is then mounted to the user's pod to allow data to be persisted through pod restarts.
