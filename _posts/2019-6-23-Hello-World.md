title: Hello World!
---

I'm a techie guy who enjoys automation, gaming, and making. I'm married with two kids, and I work for a major cloud provider.  
This is a place for me to talk about the nerdy things I'm doing that my muggle friends wouldn't be interested in trying to understand. I will be blogging as I learn and do, and I plan to start the #100DaysofCode challenge soon so expect that here. I've also been growing my beard and hair for over 6 months now in a yeard challenge so there will likely be updates on that too.
