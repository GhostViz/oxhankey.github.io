Today is Day 7 of #100DaysofK8s and I am working through [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) from [The Linux Foundation](www.linuxfoundation.org/â€Ž
) of [Edx.org](https://edx.org). The topic I covered today was [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

Logically groups pods together using services allows users and other applications to access pods in the cluster by a name rather than an IP address. Being ephemeral in nature pods do not have a static ip address and as such users and applications need a way to reliably communicate to other applications being hosted in Kubernets. This is accomplished by endpoints, made up of ip and target port of the pods, being added to services.

Kube-proxy watches the Kubernetes API to know which services and enpoints to add or remove. Additionally it runs on all worker nodes and makes changes to iptables rules to route incoming traffic that is meant for the kube cluster to the cluster. When a service is removed it updates the iptables rules also.  

Service discovery does just what it's name says. It discovers services so they can be used by other applications. This is done by either using DNS in the namespace or via environment variables which are set by the kubelet. Internal DNS is the solution that the Kubernetes team recommends.    

Some types of services are ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalIP, and ExternalName .

The blog over at BMC Blogs has a great post about [Kubernetes Services](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/kubernetes-services/).
