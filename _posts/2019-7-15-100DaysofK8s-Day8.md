Today is Day 8 of #100DaysofK8s and I am working through [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) from [The Linux Foundation](www.linuxfoundation.org/â€Ž
) of [Edx.org](https://edx.org). Today I will be deploying an application in minikube through the k8s dashboard and also through `kubectl` using a yaml file.

## Setup
I will be deploying my application to minikube. As such if you are trying to follow along you will need minikube installed. I covered this on [Day 3](100DaysofK8s/day3). I will also be accessing K8s via kubectl and the Kubernetes Dashboard. I covered how to do these on [Day 4](100DaysofK8s/4).

1. Start Minikube
```Shell
minikube start
```

2. Start the Dashboard
```Shell
minikube dashboard
```

## Deploying Using the Dashboard
### UI - Deploy


1. In the top right corner click `+CREATE`.

2. Click `Create An App`.

3. Fill in the following fields:
```Shell
App name: Webserver
Container Image: httpd:alpine
Number of pods: 3
```
> Note: Under advanced options we can set labels, namespace, resource quotas and a bunch of other options.

4. At the very bottom click the Blue `DEPLOY` button

### UI - Verifying
Your dashboard should refresh and show all the information for your new deployment.

This will show Workload Statuses, Deployments, Pods, and Replica Sets among other things.

### UI - Delete
1. From the dashboard find the deployment you want to delete and on the far right hand side there are 3 vertical dots.

2. Click the 3 vertical dots and select `Delete`.

3. You will receive a popup window confirming your decision to delete the deployment. Confirm by selecting `Delete` again.

## Deploying Using kubectl
### CLI - Deploy
Example YAML:
```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webserver
  labels:
    app: httpd
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd
        image: httpd:alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

1. Create a deployment yaml file.
```Shell
vi webserver.yaml
```

2. Deploy the file.
``` Shell
kubectl -f create webserver.yaml
```

### CLI - Verify
Use `kubectl get` for pods, deployments, and replicasets.
```Shell
[oxhankey@localhost ~]$ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
webserver-5c69f5ccbf-4w7sh   1/1     Running   0          68s
webserver-5c69f5ccbf-d2t9c   1/1     Running   0          68s
webserver-5c69f5ccbf-nvdvr   1/1     Running   0          68s
[oxhankey@localhost ~]$ kubectl get deployments
NAME        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
webserver   3/3     3            3           73s
[oxhankey@localhost ~]$ kubectl get replicasets
NAME                   DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
webserver-5c69f5ccbf   3         3         3       78s
```

### CLI - Delete
Use `kubectl delete` to delete the deployment.
```Shell
kubectl delete deployments webserver
```
> Note: Do not do this step if you want to expose the deployment with a service in the following section.

## Exposing a Service Using kubectl
### Create the Service
Use `kubectl expose` with your deployment to create a `NodePort` service.
```Shell
kubectl expose deployment webserver --name=web-service --type=NodePort
```

### Verify the Service
Use `kubectl get` for the services resource.
```Shell
[oxhankey@localhost ~]$ kubectl get services
NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes    ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP        7d3h
web-service   NodePort    10.108.128.151   <none>        80:32177/TCP   10s
```
> Note: Make a note of the web-service port directly following 80. In my case that's 32177.

### Access the Deployment Using the Service

Use the port above with the ip address of your minikube instance to access the deployed application via your web browser.
```Shell
minikube ip
```

then type something like http://192.168.99.100:32177/ in your browser to access the application.

Alternatively you can use curl with your port from above and the `minikube ip` command.
```Shell
curl `minikube ip`:32177
```
