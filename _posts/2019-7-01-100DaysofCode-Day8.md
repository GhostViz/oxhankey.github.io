Today is Day 8 of #100DaysofCode, and I started the ES6 module from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

I learned about arrow function syntax, using let and const instead of var, using Object.freeze, using .map(), .reduce(), and .filter(), rest operator, spread operator, and destructing assignments.

I also read an article on [using .map(), .reduce(), and .filter()](https://medium.com/poka-techblog/simplify-your-javascript-use-map-reduce-and-filter-bd02c593cc2d) from Poka Tech Blog on Medium.

For today's codewars challenge I worked [Swap Values](https://www.codewars.com/kata/swap-values/train/javascript). [My solution here](https://github.com/oxhankey/codewars/blob/master/javascript/swap_values.js).
