Today is Day 9 of #100DaysofCode, and I completed the ES6 module from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

I learned using template literals, writing concise object literals, writing concise declarative functions, using constructor functions, using getters and setters, using import and require and using export.

For today's codewars challenge I worked [Square Every Digit](https://www.codewars.com/kata/546e2562b03326a88e000020/train/javascript). I solved it, but I'm certain there is a more efficient way to solve it than the one I presented. Nevertheless... [My solution here](https://github.com/oxhankey/codewars/blob/master/javascript/square_every_digit.js).
