Today is Day 10 of #100DaysofCode, and I started and completed the Debugging module from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

I learned about using the javascript console for debugging, and that puts me through 4 of 9 Javascript modules.

For today's codewars challenge I worked [Binary Addition](https://www.codewars.com/kata/binary-addition). I solved it by adding variable a and variable b. From there I took the sum and converted to binary by performing the following steps as described on the [Decimal to Binary converter by Rapid Tables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html).

- Divide the number by 2.
- Get the integer quotient for the next iteration.
- Get the remainder for the binary digit.
- Repeat the steps until the quotient is equal to 0.

[My solution is available here](https://github.com/oxhankey/codewars/blob/master/javascript/binary_addition.js).

It has also been driving me crazy having undone modules for the Responsible Web Design Certification even though I've been doing HTML and CSS for over 15 years now, so I've started working through those as well just to get the green check marks. Who knows I might even learn something new.
