Today was Day 1 of my #100DaysofCode, and I started the Basic JavaScript curriculum on freecodecamp.org. I learned about declaring and using variables in addition to the following:

<h3>Math</h3>
<ul>
  <li>math operators,</li>
  <li>incrementing and decrementing numbers, </li>
  <li>floats, and</li>
  <li>compound assignments with augmented arithmetic</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Escaping quotes,</li>
  <li>using single quotes,</li>
  <li>escape sequences,</li>
  <li>concatenation,</li>
  <li>finding the length, and</li>
  <li>nth character in a string.</li>
</ul>

I also read an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems">article about accuracy problems with floating point arithmetic</a> in which the author discusses the various scenarios in which a calculation done with floating point may return data that is incorrect due to a computers limited precision in representing numbers, and I create a <a href="https://oxhankey.com/javascript_madlib.html">Javascript Madlib Game</a>.
