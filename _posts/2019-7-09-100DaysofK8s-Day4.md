Today is Day 4 of #100DaysofK8s and I am working through [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) from [The Linux Foundation](www.linuxfoundation.org/â€Ž
) of [Edx.org](https://edx.org). The topic I covered today was Accessing Minikube.


## Accessing Kubernetes
Kubernetes can be accessed via the kubectl cli tool, Kubernetes Dashboard web ui, or API.

### Kubectl
Generally kubectl is installed before minikube, but it can be installed later. Minikube takes care of configuring kubectl for you.

As I mentioned in yesterday's [100DaysofK8s post](100DaysofK8s/day3) kubectl can be installed via rpm. Alternatively it can be installed by following the instructions on [kubernetes.io's install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) page.

Once kubectl is downloaded to access your k8s cluster you will need to create a kubernetes config file in `~/.kube/config`. The [Configuring Access to Multiple Clusters] page on kubernetes.io has good information on how to accomplish this.

### Kubernetes Dashboard
To enable the kubernetes dashboard for minikube once minikube is up and running type `minikube dashboard` into your command line. This will launch your web browser and open the dashboard page. It'll be something like `http://127.0.0.1:43173/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/`.

`kubectl proxy` can also be used to start a proxy and allow dashboard access over port 8001.

### API
With `kubectl proxy`, api requests can be made directly to the cluster via curl such as `curl http://localhost:8001/healthz`.

Without the proxy, the api request header must contain a bearer token from `kubectl describe secret -n kube-system`.

`curl $APISERVER --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --insecure`

The other option besides using a bearer token is to use the cert, key, and ca from the `.kube/config` file as shown below.

`curl $APISERVER --cert encoded-cert --key encoded-key --cacert encoded-ca`
