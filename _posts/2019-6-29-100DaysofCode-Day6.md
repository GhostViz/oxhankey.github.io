Today is Day 6 of #100DaysofCode, and I continued the Regular Expressions module from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

I learned about matching numbers, letters, combinations of number and letters, and specific amounts of number and letters in a give string using match() and returning a boolean using the regular expression with test().
