Today is Day 13 of #100DaysofK8s, and I am trying to prepare a list of material to complete before attempting the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam now that I have finished the Introduction to Kubernetes course.

The curriculum for the exam is available from [CNCF on their github](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKA_Curriculum_V1.14.1.pdf), and I am still trying to decide if I want to pay the $300 to go through [Kubernetes Fundamentals](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-fundamentals/).

My plan so far is to go through Kubernetes the Hard Way by Kelsey Hightower a few times, watch the [CKA Office Hours Youtube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5cnXKhXmBeZlQSe6xBSchFCM2Mi3fYCa), and [How to Use Kubernetes by Joshual Talb from KataKoda](https://www.katacoda.com/joshuatalb/courses/kubernetes).

What do you all think? Should I plan to pay the money for [Kubernetes Fundamentals](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-fundamentals/) or will it be enough to use the freely available learning that I've found so far?  Am I missing anything that you think I should definitely go through before taking the exam? Let me know in the comments.
