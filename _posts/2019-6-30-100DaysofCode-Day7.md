Today is Day 7 of #100DaysofCode, and I completed the Regular Expressions module from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

I learned about specifying number of matches, checking for all or none, lookahead, using capture groups, and removing white space (without using trim()).

I also worked the [Sum of Positive](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5715eaedb436cf5606000381/train/javascript) problem on [CodeWars.com](https://www.codewars.com). [Solution here](https://github.com/oxhankey/codewars/blob/master/javascript/sum_of_positive.js).

Tomorrow I look forward to start the [FreeCodeCamp ES6 challenges module](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6).
