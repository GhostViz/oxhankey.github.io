Today is Day 14 of #100DaysofK8s, and I am starting to work through [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). I will be running this exercise from an i7 desktop computer with Fedora 30 installed. I am running on kernel-5.0.9-301.fc30.x86_64.

## Getting Localhost Ready

### Install tmux

Install tmux with yum.
``` Shell
sudo yum install tmux
```

This isn't required, but I'm doing it because I've been using screen and konsole on fedora or xterm2 on my mac, and I want to learn tmux. Here's a [nice guide](https://lukaszwrobel.pl/blog/tmux-tutorial-split-terminal-windows-easily/) if you're new to tmux.   

###  Install cfssl

Download cfssl linux and cfssl linux json make them executable and move them to your bin.
``` Shell
wget -q --show-progress --https-only --timestamping \
  https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64 \
  https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
sudo chmod +x cfssl_linux-amd64 cfssljson_linux-amd64
sudo mv cfssl_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssl
sudo mv cfssljson_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
```
Now verify the version:
``` Shell
cfssl version
```

### Install Google Cloud SDK

Run the following commands to create add the yum repository for Google Cloud SDK and install it via yum.
``` Shell
sudo tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/google-cloud-sdk.repo << EOM
[google-cloud-sdk]
name=Google Cloud SDK
baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/cloud-sdk-el7-x86_64
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg
       https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg
EOM

sudo yum install google-cloud-sdk
```
### Configure Google Cloud SDK

Once Google Cloud SDK is installed initialize it and create your project by answering the prompts then set your compute/zone. I chose us-west1-c.
``` Shell
gcloud init
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-c
```

### Install kubectl

Download the kubectl binary, make it executable, and move it to your bin.
``` Shell
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

Now verify the version
``` Shell
kubectl version
```

### Closing

That's it for today. My machine is ready to start with deploying the compute resources and getting the certs I need for the cluster done tomorrow.
