Today is Day 10 of #100DaysofK8s, and I am working through [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) from [The Linux Foundation](www.linuxfoundation.org/â€Ž
) of [Edx.org](https://edx.org).

Today I will be going over the section on ConfigMaps and Secrets.

### ConfigMaps
ConfigMaps are used to pass configuration data to applications running inside of a container. They can be created using `kubectl create configmap`, from a yaml file using `kubectl create -f`, or as part of a Pod definition. In any case key value pairs are pulled into a container as environment variables or mounted as a volume which is created at a specific mount point.

### Secrets
Secrets are used to pass sensitive data to applications running inside of a container. They can also be created using `kubectl create secret`, from a yaml file using `kubectl create -f`, or as part of a Pod definition.

> A few notes:
> Secrets created using a yaml file need to have the value base64 encoded.
> Secrets are stored in etcd in plain text.
