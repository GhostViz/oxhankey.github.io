Today is Day 5 of #100DaysofCode, and I worked the [Valid Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/) problem from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com). For [my solution](https://github.com/oxhankey/leetcode/blob/master/javascript/valid_number.js) to this I used regex.  I also started the javascript regex section at [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

Besides working that problem I did a bit of reading about [the differences between var and let](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-var-and-let-in-javascript/). I believe the [MDN page for let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) sums it up nicely, "let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope."
