Today is Day 3 of #100DaysofK8s and I am working through [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) from [The Linux Foundation](www.linuxfoundation.org/â€Ž
) of [Edx.org](https://edx.org). The topics I covered today were Installing Kubernetes and Minikube.

## Installing Kubernetes

There are four common Kubernetes configuration options. They include All-in-One installation, single etcd, single master, multi-worker installation, single etcd multi-master, multi-worker installations, and multi-node etcd, multi-master, multi-worker installations.

All-in-One is useful for learning and development, but not recommended for production. Of the others Multi-etcd, multi-master, multi-worker is the most resilient and is preferred for production environments.

[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/) is the preferred and recommended way to install an All-in-One Kubernetes on a local machine for development.

Kubernetes can be deployed on-prem or on public or private cloud offerings. On-prom requires the most operational overhead from the end user while public and private cloud offerings have varying levels of vendor support and operational overhead for the end users.

Some common tools for K8s deployment are kubeadm, kubesprays, kops, and kube-aws. If none of these tools fit the need K8s can also be installed from scratch. Another project that I'd like to check out in the future is [Kubernetes the Hardway by Kelsey Hightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way).

## Minikube

Minikube is an easy to deploy All-in-One installation of Kubernetes. It's perfect for local testing and development work.

### Install Minikube on Fedora 30 with VirtualBox.
When installing Minikube there are a few things to consider. You will need internet connectivity, you will need to have a VirtualBox or some other Type-2 Hypervisor installed on your local machine, virtualization must be enabled in your BIOS, and you will need to [download and install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

+ [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

  - Download the VirtualBox Repository for yum/dnf <br />
  `sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/virtualbox.repo https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/fedora/virtualbox.repo`
  - Install Prerequisite packages for kernel module <br />
  `sudo yum install binutils gcc make patch libgomp glibc-headers glibc-devel kernel-headers dkms qt5-qtx11extras libxkbcommon kernel-devel kernel-devel-5.0.9-301.fc30.x86_6`

  - Install VirtualBox <br />
  `sudo yum install VirtualBox-6.0`
  > Note: You can check the fingerprint of the key at the [Linux Downloads page of the virtualbox wiki](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads).

  - Rebuild Kernel Modules <br />
  `sudo /usr/lib/virtualbox/vboxdrv.sh setup`

  - Add VirtualBox users to vboxusers Group <br />
  `sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers user_name`

+ [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

  - Create a Kubernetes yum repository file <br />
  `sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxhankey/oxhankey.github.io/master/downloads/kubernetes.repo`

  - Install kubectl <br />
  `sudo yum install -y kubectl`

+ [Install Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)

  - Download the Minikube package and move it to your PATH <br />
  `sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minikube`

+ Start Minikube <br />
`minikube start`

+ Verify Installation <br />
`minikube status`

There you have it. A successfully installed minikube deployment.

If you decide you want to tear down this deployment just use `minikube destroy`.
