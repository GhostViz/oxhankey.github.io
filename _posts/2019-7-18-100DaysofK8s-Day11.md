Today is Day 11 of #100DaysofK8s, and I am working through [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) from [The Linux Foundation](www.linuxfoundation.org/â€Ž
) of [Edx.org](https://edx.org).

Today I will be going over the section on Ingress.

Explain what Ingress and Ingress Controllers are.
### Ingress
According to kubernetes.io, "An Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the cluster Services." It configures a Layer 7 load balancer for Services utilizing something like nginx, haproxy, or istio. Ingress is great to expose multiple services under a single IP address.


### Ingress Controllers
Ingress Controllers are applications that watch the Kubernetes API for changes in an ingress resource and then update the load balancer as needed.
