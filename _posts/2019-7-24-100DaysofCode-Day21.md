Today is Day 21 of #100DaysofCode. I continued the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges and the Object Oriented Programming Module from the freeCodeCamp Javascript course.

I finished the Object Oriented Programming module and learned about prototypes, inheritance, closure, mixins, and IIFEs. I even read a [nice article about IIFEs](https://medium.com/@vvkchandra/essential-javascript-mastering-immediately-invoked-function-expressions-67791338ddc6).
