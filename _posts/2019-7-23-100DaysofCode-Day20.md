Today is Day 20 of #100DaysofCode. I started the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges and the Object Oriented Programming Module from the freeCodeCamp Javascript course.

I got halfway though Object Oriented Programming and plan to finish it tomorrow.

I did the first Intermediate Javascript Algorithm Scripting challenge and have posted it on [github](https://github.com/oxhankey/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/jsIntermediateAlgorithms/sumAllNumbersInRange.js). I'll work through these as I'm going through the next few sections on JavaScript. Hopefully by Mid-August I'll be done with JavaScript Certificate and can move on to APIs and Microservices.
