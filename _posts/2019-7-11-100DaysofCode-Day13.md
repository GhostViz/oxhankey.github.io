Today is Day 13 of #100DaysofCode. I started and completed the Basic Algorithm Scripting module from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

Today was a busy day so I didn't get in as much coding time as I would have liked, but some time is better than no time at all. I completed the Reverse a String and Celsius to Fahrenheit challenges.

Reverse a String
```JavaScript
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}
```

Celsius to Fahrenheit
```JavaScript
function convertToF(celsius) {
  let fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32;
  return fahrenheit;
}
```
